    """Re-derive invariants from stored chunks and report coverage.

    Two guarantees, deliberately separated:

      retrievable : every invariant extracted from the original content can be
                    recovered from the store (anchor + chunks). This is the "zéro
                    perte" promise and must ALWAYS be 1.0.
      in_context  : the fraction of invariants that sit in the ANCHOR, i.e. what the
                    model sees without asking for anything. Quality metric, not
                    correctness — it is expected to be < 1.0 on large inputs, because
                    the anchor is a summary and the drawer holds the rest.

    `lossless` in the returned report means *retrievable*. The previous meaning
    ("everything is inside the anchor") reported false on inputs that were in fact
    perfectly recoverable.

    The invariant set is read from the store when available (it was computed once at
    store time); otherwise it is recomputed from the chunks. This keeps verification
    fast even on a very large session.
